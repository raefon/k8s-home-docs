# Introduction

When code for the containers is mainteined by the k8s-at-home community, we
keep the projects in their own GitHub project instead of
[container images](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/container-images). This allows
the project to cover the development and release of projects versions there.

The projects build containers and upload them to
[GHCR](https://github.com/orgs/k8s-at-home/packages?ecosystem=container)
so for the users they do not differ from other images.

The development process is on the other hand different from the
[container images](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/container-images) so
please refer to the development docummentation for the details.
