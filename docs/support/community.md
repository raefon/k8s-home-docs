# Community

We have a few outlets for getting community support with our projects:

## Issues

If you encounter an issue when using our charts or container images, please add
it to their respective GitHub Issues tracker. Please make sure you use the
provided issue templates so that can better understand your issue as well as
duplicate it on our end!

## Forum

We use [GitHub Discussions][github discussions] to provide a forum to hold
discussions among the community. Everything that is not an issue but is related
to k8s@home can be discussed here: use-cases, requests for help and
suggestions, discussions on the future of projects, and other similar topics.

## Chat

We use Discord as a chat solution for allowing both k8s@home users and developers
to interact in real time. Click [here][discord] for an invitation.
