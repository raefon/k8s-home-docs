### Why aren't the charts updated with each image release?

k8s@home feels that it is the responsibility of the person deploying the chart
to ensure that the most up to date image is being deployed as well as keeping
the deployed images up to date. Keeping images would be a full time job due
to the frequent code changes and so the the k8s@home community would rather
spend their time implementing new features and charts for everyone to use.
